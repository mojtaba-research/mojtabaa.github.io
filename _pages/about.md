## About Me

I am a second year Ph.D. student in T\&O at the Ross School of Business (University of Michigan) where I am advised by Izak Duenyas and Roman Kapuscinski. I am also pursuing an M.S. in Statistics. Previously, I earned a Ph.D. in Transportation Systems Engineering, ann an M.Sc. in Industrial and Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan, and dual B.Sc. degrees in Mathematics and Civil Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My current research focuses on designing dynamic experimentation, inspection, and statistical tests in strategic environments—a pursuit that integrates online decision-making, statistical inference, and operations research. I leverage tools like stochastic systems analysis, approximation algorithms, online learning, and large deviation analysis to address complex challenges in these areas. My work has been recognized with honors such as the Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship (2022) IBM best student paper award finalist (2024).
